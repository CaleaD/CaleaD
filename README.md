- 👋 My name is Dora, welcome to my Github
- 📚 I'm a strong-willed programmer looking to enrich my knowledge about industry technologies and software engineering
- 💻 I’m interested in Big Data and Web Development - additionaly I automate tedious tasks from time to time since I like being efficient with my time (plus - it's good practice and a lot of fun)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue.js, tackling a personal project and completing some aptitude assessments for my applications
- 💼 I'm looking for an entry-level job in the aforementioned fields, however, I'm open to doing internships - my leading objective at the moment is to learn as much as I can and be proactive in my pursuit
- 👥 If you simply want to connect and collaborate I would like to know what you have in mind - it's a medium where ideas can prosper into more and I'm here to do exactly that
- 📫 How to reach me: dora.calea@gmail.com
